Hey there!  I just finished a cool  project in Tableau and wanted to share it with you. It’s a dashboard called "Electric Vehicle Data Analysis" that looks at stuff like how many electric vehicles are out there, their average range, and where they’re most popular in the U.S. I went with a simple green design that’s easy to look at.
Here’s the quick rundown:  
Total Vehicles: 1.15 million  

Average Range: About 68 miles  

Top Brands: Tesla’s way ahead (almost half!), then Nissan and Chevrolet.  

Top Models: Model Y and Model 3 from Tesla, plus Nissan’s Leaf.  

Where They’re At: Washington’s got the most (150K), with California, New Jersey, and New York trailing behind.  

Growth: It’s been climbing since 2010, though it slowed a bit in 2022 and 2023.

I played around with maps, charts, and a table to make the numbers pop. Honestly, digging into this was pretty eye-opening—I learned a ton about where electric vehicles are headed.
Take a peek at the dashboard if you’ve got a sec! What do you think about these trends? Got any thoughts on electric cars and where they’re taking us? I’d love to hear from you—let’s talk about it!
